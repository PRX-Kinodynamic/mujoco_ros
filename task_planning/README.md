# Task Planning
## TODOs
- [x] Enable visualization of the planning goal.
- [ ] Add obstacles to the scene.
- [ ] Ensure two-way mapping between obstacle yaml files (for ML4KP) and MuJoCo XML files
- [ ] Replace the current `feedback_client` (or at least refactor it) so it spawns `mushr_visualize` and connects via topics.
- [ ] Add goal radius/goal check to planner query?
- [ ] Re-planning node
