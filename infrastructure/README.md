# Infrastructure
## interface
A perception output in, controls out infrastructure for sim or real-robot agnostic communication.

## prx_models
* Robot Models, either real or for simulation
* Robot-specific messages/services

## ml4kp_bridge
* Import of [ML4KP](https://github.com/PRX-Kinodynamic/ML4KP-devel) for planning, estimation and control.


## TODOs
- [ ] `imgs/` directory inside `prx_models/models/`	is sometimes not extracted correctly.
- [ ] Do we need `mushr_sim_interface.cpp` anymore?
